- `stockreport.pl & echo aiwefwlguh & 29`
이는 일부 유형의 OS 명령 삽입을 테스트하는 유용한 방법입니다. 문자 `&`는 쉘 명령 구분 기호입니다. 이 예에서는 세 개의 개별 명령이 차례로 실행됩니다. 사용자에게 반환되는 출력은 다음과 같습니다.

테스트 시 &  -> %26 으로 넣고 해야함 
```
Error - productID was not provided
aiwefwlguh
29: command not found
```


## What is OS command injection?

OS command injection is also known as shell injection. It allows an attacker to execute operating system (OS) commands on the server that is running an application, and typically fully compromise the application and its data. Often, an attacker can leverage an OS command injection vulnerability to compromise other parts of the hosting infrastructure, and exploit trust relationships to pivot the attack to other systems within the organization.

## Useful commands

After you identify an OS command injection vulnerability, it's useful to execute some initial commands to obtain information about the system. Below is a summary of some commands that are useful on Linux and Windows platforms:

|Purpose of command|Linux|Windows|
|---|---|---|
|Name of current user|`whoami`|`whoami`|
|Operating system|`uname -a`|`ver`|
|Network configuration|`ifconfig`|`ipconfig /all`|
|Network connections|`netstat -an`|`netstat -an`|
|Running processes|`ps -ef`|`tasklist`|

## Injecting OS commands

In this example, a shopping application lets the user view whether an item is in stock in a particular store. This information is accessed via a URL:

`   https://insecure-website.com/stockStatus?productID=381&storeID=29`

To provide the stock information, the application must query various legacy systems. For historical reasons, the functionality is implemented by calling out to a shell command with the product and store IDs as arguments:

`stockreport.pl 381 29`

This command outputs the stock status for the specified item, which is returned to the user.

## Injecting OS commands - Continued

The application implements no defenses against OS command injection, so an attacker can submit the following input to execute an arbitrary command:

`& echo aiwefwlguh &`

If this input is submitted in the `productID` parameter, the command executed by the application is:

`stockreport.pl & echo aiwefwlguh & 29`

The `echo` command causes the supplied string to be echoed in the output. This is a useful way to test for some types of OS command injection. The `&` character is a shell command separator. In this example, it causes three separate commands to execute, one after another. The output returned to the user is:

```
Error - productID was not provided 
aiwefwlguh 
29: command not found
```

The three lines of output demonstrate that:

- The original `stockreport.pl` command was executed without its expected arguments, and so returned an error message.
- The injected `echo` command was executed, and the supplied string was echoed in the output.
- The original argument `29` was executed as a command, which caused an error.

Placing the additional command separator `&` after the injected command is useful because it separates the injected command from whatever follows the injection point. This reduces the chance that what follows will prevent the injected command from executing.
